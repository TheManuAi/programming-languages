# Practice Python Coding Questions (Chapters 1–6)

This collection of coding problems is designed to give hands-on practice with Python concepts as introduced in _Python for Everybody_ (Chapters 1–6). Each section contains a set of exercises that focus on coding.

## Chapter 1: Getting Started

1. **Hello, World!**  
   Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

2. **Personal Greeting**  
   Write a program that prints your name and age in a friendly greeting message.

3. **Simple Sum Calculator**  
   Write a program that asks the user to input two numbers, then calculates and prints their sum.

## Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, and Statements

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user for two numbers.
   - Calculates and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

2. **Rectangle Calculator**  
   Write a program that:

   - Asks the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle.
   - Calculates and prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

3. **Simple Interest Calculator**  
   Write a program that:
   - Prompts the user to input the principal, annual interest rate (in percentage), and time (in years).
   - Calculates and prints the simple interest.

## Chapter 3: Conditional Execution

1. **Number Classification**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user for a number.
   - Determines and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. **Leap Year Checker**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user to enter a year.
   - Determines whether the given year is a leap year and prints an appropriate message.

3. **Grade Calculator**  
   Write a program that:
   - Asks the user for a student's score (0–100).
   - Prints out the corresponding letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F) based on a grading scale of your choice.

## Chapter 4: Functions

1. **Factorial Function**  
   Write a function `factorial(n)` that:

   - Takes an integer `n` and returns its factorial.
   - Then, use the function to print the factorial of a number provided by the user.

2. **Average Calculator**  
   Write a function `calculate_average(numbers)` that:

   - Accepts a list of numbers.
   - Returns the average of those numbers.
   - Test your function with a sample list of numbers.

3. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**  
   Write a function `fibonacci(n)` that:
   - Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Write a program that uses this function to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Chapter 5: Loops and Iteration

1. **Prime Numbers Generator**  
   Write a program that:

   - Uses a loop to print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.

2. **List Summation**  
   Write a program that:

   - Takes a list of numbers.
   - Uses a loop (do not use built-in functions like `sum()`) to calculate and print the sum of the numbers.

3. **Multiplication Table**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user for a number.
   - Prints the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) for that number.

4. **Accumulating Sum with While Loop**  
   Write a program that:
   - Continuously asks the user for numbers and keeps a running total.
   - Stops asking for input when the user enters a negative number.
   - Prints the final sum.

## Chapter 6: Strings

1. **Character by Character**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user to input a string.
   - Prints each character of the string on a separate line.

2. **Vowel Counter**  
   Write a program that:

   - Prompts the user for a string.
   - Counts and prints the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

3. **String Reversal**  
   Write a program that:

   - Takes a string input from the user.
   - Prints the reversed string without using any built-in reverse functions.

4. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Write a program that:
   - Prompts the user for a string.
   - Checks and prints whether the string is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).
