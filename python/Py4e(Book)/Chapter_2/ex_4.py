#1.  width // 2 -> gives floor division which is 17 // 2 -> which will give 8.5 but it will delete the part of decimal and return 8
print(width // 2)

#2. width / 2.0 -> is just a simple division which is 17 / 2 -> which will return 8.5
print(width / 2)

#3. height / 3 -> simple division -> 12.0 / 3 -> 4.0
print(height / 3)

#4 1 + 2 * 5 -> Using the PEMDAS acronym -> 1 + 10 -> 11
print(1 + 2 * 5)
