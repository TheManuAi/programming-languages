# Programming Languages Learnings

Welcome to the **Programming Languages Learnings** repository! This repo tracks my journey of learning programming languages like Python, C, C++, and more.


## Purpose
- To organize notes, exercises, and projects by language and course/creator.
- To document progress and key learnings.
- To serve as a quick reference for programming concepts.

## Repository Structure
```
programming-languages/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ [Language Name]/            # Folder for each programming language (e.g., Python, C)
    â”œâ”€â”€ [Course or Creator Name]/ # Folder named after the course or creator (e.g., CS50, 100 days of code)
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Notes on what I have learned so far
        â”œâ”€â”€ exercises/          # Practice problems and solutions
        â”œâ”€â”€ projects/           # Folder for projects
```

## How to Use
1. Select a language folder to explore.
2. Navigate to the course or creator folder for detailed learnings.
3. Review the `README.md` for notes and summaries.
4. Check `exercises/` and `projects/` for practice and implementations.

## Future Updates
This repository will be regularly updated as I progress through different courses and projects. Stay tuned for more additions!
